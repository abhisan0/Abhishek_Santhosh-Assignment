Hyperspectral DON Prediction

This is my assignment for the AI/ML internship at ImagoAI. I did it in Google Colab to predict DON concentration in corn.

## How to Run
1. Open my Colab notebook `Assignment.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload `TASK-ML-INTERN.csv` to Colab and run all cells.
3. You’ll need these libraries:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn
   - xgboost

## Files
- `my_assignment.ipynb`: My Colab code and results.
- `report.md: My short report.
- I didn’t upload the dataset because it might be private.
